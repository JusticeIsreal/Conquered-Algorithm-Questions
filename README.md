This is a list of some of my Conquered Algorithm Questions , 
here i solved algorithms using javscript programming language.
the solutions give a large range of application of javascript methods and functions.
I also solved questions on data structure ranging from linked list , double linked list, Queue, stacks, Binary search trees , hash map , graph etc
feel free to clone and I am open to any discussion  for better approach to the problem.
